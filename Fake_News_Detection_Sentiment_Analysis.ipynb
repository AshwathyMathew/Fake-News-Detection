Sanders, an independent on the Senate Budget Committee, said the ruling could mean that provisions related to educational savings accounts for home schooling and private university endowments could be struck from the measure unless 60 members of the Senate vote to uphold them.\",\n          \"(Reuters) - A lottery drawing to settle a tied Virginia legislative race that could shift the statehouse balance of power has been indefinitely postponed, state election officials said on Tuesday, after the Democratic candidate mounted a legal fight. The decision to put off the high-stakes lotto, originally scheduled for Wednesday, marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed Democrat Shelly Simonds beating Republican incumbent David Yancey by a single vote.\\u00a0 A victory by Simonds would shift Republicans\\u2019 slim control of the 100-member House of Delegates to an even 50-50 split with the Democrats, forcing the two parties into a rare power-sharing arrangement. A day after Simonds emerged as the victor of a recount, a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey. That decision left the two candidates tied with 11,608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of Newport News in southeastern Virginia, setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner. Simonds asked a state court to reconsider on Tuesday, arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included. An image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names, with a slash mark by Simonds\\u2019 name. The voter selected Republicans for other offices. Simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole, saying that without a court ruling in her favor, \\u201crecounts would become a never-ending spiral of courtroom challenges.\\u201d The chairman of the Virginia Board of Elections, James Alcorn, said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law, such a move should be considered \\u201can action of last resort.\\u201d He added: \\u201cAny substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.\\u201d\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Yancey\\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Virginia House Republican Caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings. \\u201cWe believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question,\\u201d spokesman Parker Slaybaugh said. Virginia Department of Elections spokeswoman Andrea Gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set. Democrats notched historic gains in Virginia\\u2019s statehouse elections last month, part of the party\\u2019s first big wave of political victories since Republican Donald Trump won the White House last year. Before the Nov. 7 general election, Virginia Republicans held 66 seats to the Democrats\\u2019 34 in the House of Delegates, along with a majority in the state Senate.\",\n          \"Republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare but they failed miserably. After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,\\u00a0 We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,\\u00a0 he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that\\u00a0 This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,\\u00a0 the Kentucky Republican said.\\u00a0 We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is\\u00a0 not interested\\u00a0 in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,\\u00a0 McConnell said.\\u00a0 The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his\\u00a0 number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president. Well, we re hoping that Trump doesn t last a full term. Funny how that works.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false,\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The only problem is that it never happened. Before boarding the plane to come home, Trump told the press that Air Force One was denied landing rights in the Philippines during a trip by his predecessor because U.S. relations with the nation were so bad.Trump said Air Force One\\u00a0 never got to land\\u00a0 in the Philippines while be bragged about having\\u00a0 a very strong relationship\\u00a0 with the Southeast Asian nation. And as you know, we were having a lot of problems with the Philippines. The relationship with the past administration was horrible, to use a nice word,\\u00a0 Trump told reporters in Manila. I would say\\u00a0 horrible\\u00a0 is putting it mildly. You know what happened. Many of you were there, and you never got to land,\\u00a0 he continued.\\u00a0 The plane came close but it didn t land. The Associated Press fact-checked Trump s bizarre claim:President Barack Obama last visited the Philippines in November 2015, arriving in Manila after an overnight flight from Turkey. There were no problems with landing the plane. Obama used the visit to announce the United States was transferring two ships to the Philippine Navy.Perhaps Trump was referring erroneously to Obama s aborted meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte? In September 2016, Obama abruptly canceled a meeting with the new Philippines leader in Laos after Duterte called him an obscene name. Duterte was warning Obama not to speak with him about the brutality of his crackdown on the illegal drug trade.Obama did visit the Philippines on several trips earlier in his presidency and even signed an enhanced defense cooperation agreement with the country in 2014, but Trump claimed that our relationship with the Philipines is\\u00a0 probably better than ever before. So it s very important that we get along with the Philippines, and we really do. We have a very good relationship. I would actually say probably better than ever before,\\u00a0 he said.Duterte has carried out an unlawful crackdown on suspected drug dealers and users, resulting in at least 7 thousand deaths by means including execution using death squads. Hitler massacred 3 million Jews. There are 3 million drug addicts. I d be happy to slaughter them,\\u00a0 Duterte declared in 2015.However, while Trump was there he largely ignored any discussion of human rights with the dictator. We understand that Trump is jealous of President Obama, but his lies prove why he has so much disdain for fact-checkers. It s sad that he doesn t have that same disdain for murderous dictators, though.Photo by Zach Gibson \\u00a0 Pool/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Donald Trump probably wishes the United States was more like the Philippines.Trump was downright chummy with mass murderer and human rights violator Rodrigo Duterte on Monday during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit in Manila.Not only did Trump refuse to nail Duterte for violating human rights, he laughed when Duterte accused journalists of being\\u00a0 spies\\u00a0 when they peppered the dictatorial duo with questions about human rights. We would be talking on matters that are of interest of both the Philippines and\\u00a0 With you around guys, you are the spies,\\u00a0 Duterte said, drawing laughter from Trump.Bloomber reporter Jennifer Jacobs chronicled how Duterte and Trump treated journalists at the Summit.Duterte made a joke at end of Trump bilat.As press being shooed out, Duterte said:\\u00a0 We will be talking on matters of interest to both the Philippines and Then he said:\\u00a0 With you around, guys, you are the spies. Trump chuckled. pic.twitter.com/dQ2fx9Sj8T\\u00a0 Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) November 13, 2017When reporters asked Pres Trump if he would bring up human rights with Duterte, Duterte shut it down saying this was not a news conference.\\u00a0 Steve Holland (@steveholland1) November 13, 2017 I would like for the media to leave us alone. You may leave the room,\\u00a0 Duterte says, just minutes into summit meeting.Press ushered out. pic.twitter.com/lhfFgp3xJU\\u00a0 Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) November 13, 2017Trump has been attacking the media since he announced his candidacy back in 2015. And he has relentlessly attacked the media since taking office, accusing journalists of writing or reporting\\u00a0 fake news. Ever since he became the Philippine leader, Duterte has been responsible for the killing of 100,000 people, casualties of a war on drugs Duterte promised to wage during his campaign.President Obama was a sharp critic of Duterte, and Duterte retaliated by calling him the\\u00a0 son of a whore\\u00a0 and sought closer ties with China and Russia. Of course, Trump likes Duterte and has avoided calling him out for his abuse of power. Trump even invited Duterte to the White House.Trump s amusement at Duterte s remarks about journalists are particularly alarming since the Philippines is one of the most deadly places on Earth for journalists.Newsweek reports that 177 journalists have been killed there since 1986.And Trump added further insult to injury by not even discussing Duterte s terrible human rights record. Instead, he let Duterte do all the talking and merely nodded in agreement with him. Once again, Trump demonstrates that he is a coward who can be walked over by other world leaders. Conservatives bitched and moaned whenever President Obama bowed to greet some world leaders. But apparently they are okay with Trump just laying down.Featured Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\",\n          \"After Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was finally publicly outed after decades of alleged sexual abuses toward women, a #metoo hashtag formed and a dam broke. Suddenly it seemed that every time we turned on our computers, every time we received a phone alert, it was yet another man outed as an abuser.The worst of the worst of sexual abusers, though, are those who abuse children. Roy Moore, the right-wing Christian nut-job who s running for Senate in Alabama has been accused of doing just that. Five women have now come forward alleging that Moore\\u00a0 dated\\u00a0 them and worse while they were teens and he was in his 30s.This all began almost a year to the day after an audio tape of Donald Trump bragging about how he s such a big star he can just grab women s pussies. Is it possible, though, that Trump is as bad, if not worse, than Moore?While liberals and Democrats have decried the alleged abusers, regardless of ideology or party affiliation, Republicans have taken a *shall we say* more nuanced stance when it comes to Moore. They have invoked the Bible, saying that the Virgin Mary was a teenager when Jesus was born. Of course, much like they forget the\\u00a0 well regulated militia\\u00a0 part of the Second Amendment, these men who would slut shame their own sisters if they were Democrats who wanted birth control, suddenly forgot the first part of Mary s moniker. They also defended Moore by saying that he was just a fragile young buck of 32, who couldn t have possibly known better, while his alleged victims were well on their way to adulthood at 14 and 16.Donald Trump has been surprisingly mum about the Moore allegations, but spokesperson Kellyanne Conway carefully straddled the line by saying that\\u00a0 if\\u00a0 the allegations were true, Moore should resign. Trump, though, had something interesting to say about the subject of statutory rape three years ago. In a tweet, Trump called it\\u00a0 talent\\u00a0 to\\u00a0 date\\u00a0 a woman who s young enough to be his daughter. Note: he was married to Melania at the time.@rexrode_lisa \\\"@realDonaldTrump you date girls young enough to be your daughter.That's perverted\\\" Dated. No, that's talent.\\u00a0 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2013\\u00a0 This wasn t the first time Trump expressed interest in young girls. At least twice, Trump was heard saying that he would soon be dating girls who, at the time, were very underaged.Donald Trump once told 14-year-old girls, 'In a couple of years, I'll be dating you' https://t.co/nslYeqp8dg pic.twitter.com/ayDeW6nGNz\\u00a0 L.A. Times Politics (@latimespolitics) October 13, 2016\\u00a0 In 1992, he said about a 10-year-old girl that he would be\\u00a0 dating her in 10 years.\\u00a0 Here s the video:All of this, of course, was out there before the election and Trump voters didn t care. Trump voters in Alabama don t care about the allegations against Moore either. A poll taken after the accusations began to surface showed Moore with a 10 point lead against his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones. If we haven t thrown in the moral towel as a country, Republicans certainly have. Jerry Falwell s moral majority has turned into an immoral minority of right-wing ideologues who would pimp out their own daughters if it meant putting another Republican in Congress.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS\\u2019 \\u201cFace the Nation,\\u201d drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense \\u201cdiscretionary\\u201d spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. \\u201cThe (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: \\u2018We\\u2019re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,\\u2019\\u201d Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. \\u201cNow, Democrats are saying that\\u2019s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don\\u2019t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people\\u2019s money,\\u201d he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party\\u2019s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. \\u201cIt\\u2019s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,\\u201d Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the\\u00a0 United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. \\u201cThis is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we\\u2019ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we\\u2019re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,\\u201d Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,\\u00a0 will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or \\u201centitlement reform,\\u201d as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, \\u201centitlement\\u201d programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan\\u2019s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the \\u201cDreamers,\\u201d people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. \\u201cWe need to do DACA clean,\\u201d she said.\\u00a0 On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid.\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          \"100\",\n          \"199\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.'"

The decision to put off the high-stakes lotto, originally scheduled for Wednesday, marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed Democrat Shelly Simonds beating Republican incumbent David Yancey by a single vote.\\u00a0 A victory by Simonds would shift Republicans\\u2019 slim control of the 100-member House of Delegates to an even 50-50 split with the Democrats, forcing the two parties into a rare power-sharing arrangement. A day after Simonds emerged as the victor of a recount, a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey. That decision left the two candidates tied with 11,608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of Newport News in southeastern Virginia, setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner. Simonds asked a state court to reconsider on Tuesday, arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included. An image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names, with a slash mark by Simonds\\u2019 name. The voter selected Republicans for other offices. Simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole, saying that without a court ruling in her favor, \\u201crecounts would become a never-ending spiral of courtroom challenges.\\u201d The chairman of the Virginia Board of Elections, James Alcorn, said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law, such a move should be considered \\u201can action of last resort.\\u201d He added: \\u201cAny substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.\\u201d\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Yancey\\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Virginia House Republican Caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings. \\u201cWe believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question,\\u201d spokesman Parker Slaybaugh said. Virginia Department of Elections spokeswoman Andrea Gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set. Democrats notched historic gains in Virginia\\u2019s statehouse elections last month, part of the party\\u2019s first big wave of political victories since Republican Donald Trump won the White House last year. Before the Nov. 7 general election, Virginia Republicans held 66 seats to the Democrats\\u2019 34 in the House of Delegates, along with a majority in the state Senate.\",\n          \"Republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare but they failed miserably. After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,\\u00a0 We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,\\u00a0 he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that\\u00a0 This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,\\u00a0 the Kentucky Republican said.\\u00a0 We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is\\u00a0 not interested\\u00a0 in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,\\u00a0 McConnell said.\\u00a0 The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his\\u00a0 number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president. Well, we re hoping that Trump doesn t last a full term. Funny how that works.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said.\n"

            "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transgender people will be allowed for the first time to enlist in the U.S. military starting on Monday as ordered by federal courts, the Pentagon said on Friday, after President Donald Trump’s administration decided not to appeal rulings that blocked his transgender ban. Two federal appeals courts, one in Washington and one in Virginia, last week rejected the administration’s request to put on hold orders by lower court judges requiring the military to begin accepting transgender recruits on Jan. 1. A Justice Department official said the administration will not challenge those rulings. “The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks. So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in District Court in the meantime,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. In September, the Pentagon said it had created a panel of senior officials to study how to implement a directive by Trump to prohibit transgender individuals from serving. The Defense Department has until Feb. 21 to submit a plan to Trump. Lawyers representing currently-serving transgender service members and aspiring recruits said they had expected the administration to appeal the rulings to the conservative-majority Supreme Court, but were hoping that would not happen. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement: “As mandated by court order, the Department of Defense is prepared to begin accessing transgender applicants for military service Jan. 1. All applicants must meet all accession standards.” Jennifer Levi, a lawyer with gay, lesbian and transgender advocacy group GLAD, called the decision not to appeal “great news.” “I’m hoping it means the government has come to see that there is no way to justify a ban and that it’s not good for the military or our country,” Levi said. Both GLAD and the American Civil Liberties Union represent plaintiffs in the lawsuits filed against the administration. In a move that appealed to his hard-line conservative supporters, Trump announced in July that he would prohibit transgender people from serving in the military, reversing Democratic President Barack Obama’s policy of accepting them. Trump said on Twitter at the time that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.” Four federal judges - in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Riverside, California - have issued rulings blocking Trump’s ban while legal challenges to the Republican president’s policy proceed. The judges said the ban would likely violate the right under the U.S. Constitution to equal protection under the law. The Pentagon on Dec. 8 issued guidelines to recruitment personnel in order to enlist transgender applicants by Jan. 1. The memo outlined medical requirements and specified how the applicants’ sex would be identified and even which undergarments they would wear. The Trump administration previously said in legal papers that the armed forces were not prepared to train thousands of personnel on the medical standards needed to process transgender applicants and might have to accept “some individuals who are not medically fit for service.” The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, to begin accepting transgender recruits. But Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, postponed that date to Jan. 1, 2018, which the president’s ban then put off indefinitely. Trump has taken other steps aimed at rolling back transgender rights. In October, his administration said a federal law banning gender-based workplace discrimination does not protect transgender employees, reversing another Obama-era position. In February, Trump rescinded guidance issued by the Obama administration saying that public schools should allow transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity.\n"

The decision to put off the high-stakes lotto, originally scheduled for Wednesday, marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed Democrat Shelly Simonds beating Republican incumbent David Yancey by a single vote.\\u00a0 A victory by Simonds would shift Republicans\\u2019 slim control of the 100-member House of Delegates to an even 50-50 split with the Democrats, forcing the two parties into a rare power-sharing arrangement. A day after Simonds emerged as the victor of a recount, a three-judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for Yancey. That decision left the two candidates tied with 11,608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of Newport News in southeastern Virginia, setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner. Simonds asked a state court to reconsider on Tuesday, arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included. An image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names, with a slash mark by Simonds\\u2019 name. The voter selected Republicans for other offices. Simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole, saying that without a court ruling in her favor, \\u201crecounts would become a never-ending spiral of courtroom challenges.\\u201d The chairman of the Virginia Board of Elections, James Alcorn, said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law, such a move should be considered \\u201can action of last resort.\\u201d He added: \\u201cAny substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.\\u201d\\u00a0 \\u00a0 Yancey\\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Virginia House Republican Caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings. \\u201cWe believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question,\\u201d spokesman Parker Slaybaugh said. Virginia Department of Elections spokeswoman Andrea Gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set. Democrats notched historic gains in Virginia\\u2019s statehouse elections last month, part of the party\\u2019s first big wave of political victories since Republican Donald Trump won the White House last year. Before the Nov. 7 general election, Virginia Republicans held 66 seats to the Democrats\\u2019 34 in the House of Delegates, along with a majority in the state Senate.\",\n          \"Republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare but they failed miserably. After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,\\u00a0 We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,\\u00a0 he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that\\u00a0 This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,\\u00a0 the Kentucky Republican said.\\u00a0 We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is\\u00a0 not interested\\u00a0 in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,\\u00a0 McConnell said.\\u00a0 The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his\\u00a0 number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president. Well, we re hoping that Trump doesn t last a full term.

not been a very bipartisan year. i hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. an obamacare repeal in 2018 is doa. well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 senate,\\u00a0 the kentucky republican said.\\u00a0 we ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 senate. but i think we ll probably move on to other issues. npr reports:mcconnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate republican sen. susan collins of maine to get her support for the tax bill.on top of that mcconnell broke with house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like medicaid and food stamps. mcconnell told npr he is\\u00a0 not interested\\u00a0 in using senate budget rules to allow republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with democrats. i think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,\\u00a0 mcconnell said.\\u00a0 the house may have a different agenda. if our democratic friends in the senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. i d be happy to take a look at it. this is coming from mitch mcconnell. he knows donald trump is destroying the gop. it doesn t matter, sen. mcconnell. we still recall him saying that his\\u00a0 number one priority is making sure president obama s a one-term president. well, we re hoping that trump doesn t last a full term. funny how that works.photo by chip

reuters    a lottery drawing to settle a tied virginia legislative race that could shift the statehouse balance of power has been indefinitely postponed  state election officials said on tuesday  after the democratic candidate mounted a legal fight  the decision to put off the high stakes lotto  originally scheduled for wednesday  marks the latest twist in a dramatic election recount that at one point showed democrat shelly simonds beating republican incumbent david yancey by a single vote   a victory by simonds would shift republicans  slim control of the 100 member house of delegates to an even 50 50 split with the democrats  forcing the two parties into a rare power sharing arrangement  a day after simonds emerged as the victor of a recount  a three judge panel ruled that a disputed ballot should be counted for yancey  that decision left the two candidates tied with 11 608 votes each in a district that encompasses the shipping hub of newport news in southeastern virginia  setting the stage for the equivalent of a coin toss to pick a final winner  simonds asked a state court to reconsider on tuesday  arguing that the disputed ballot was wrongly included  an image filed in court showed that the ballot had bubbles filled in beside both names  with a slash mark by simonds  name  the voter selected republicans for other offices  simonds told reporters that the case had implications not only for her contest but for the integrity of state elections as a whole  saying that without a court ruling in her favor   recounts would become a never ending spiral of courtroom challenges   the chairman of the virginia board of elections  james alcorn  said in a statement that while holding a lottery would be in keeping with state law  such a move should be considered  an action of last resort   he added   any substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted      yancey s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment  the virginia house republican caucus said in a statement that it was reviewing the new court filings   we believe the court acted appropriately and that the integrity of the process is without question   spokesman parker slaybaugh said  virginia department of elections spokeswoman andrea gaines said in an email that no new date for a drawing has been set  democrats notched historic gains in virginia s statehouse elections last month  part of the party s first big wave of political victories since republican donald trump won the white house last year  before the

        "#new_review = '''(Reuters) - Alabama officials on Thursday certified Democrat Doug Jones the winner of the state’s U.S. Senate race, after a state judge denied a challenge by Republican Roy Moore, whose campaign was derailed by accusations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. Jones won the vacant seat by about 22,000 votes, or 1.6 percentage points, election officials said. That made him the first Democrat in a quarter of a century to win a Senate seat in Alabama.  The seat was previously held by Republican Jeff Sessions, who was tapped by U.S. President Donald Trump as attorney general. A state canvassing board composed of Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, Governor Kay Ivey and Attorney General Steve Marshall certified the election results. Seating Jones will narrow the Republican majority in the Senate to 51 of 100 seats. In a statement, Jones called his victory “a new chapter” and pledged to work with both parties. Moore declined to concede defeat even after Trump urged him to do so. He stood by claims of a fraudulent election in a statement released after the certification and said he had no regrets, media outlets reported. An Alabama judge denied Moore’s request to block certification of the results of the Dec. 12 election in a decision shortly before the canvassing board met. Moore’s challenge alleged there had been potential voter fraud that denied him a chance of victory. His filing on Wednesday in the Montgomery Circuit Court sought to halt the meeting scheduled to ratify Jones’ win on Thursday. Moore could ask for a recount, in addition to possible other court challenges, Merrill said in an interview with Fox News Channel. He would have to complete paperwork “within a timed period” and show he has the money for a challenge, Merrill said. “We’ve not been notified yet of their intention to do that,” Merrill said. Regarding the claim of voter fraud, Merrill told CNN that more than 100 cases had been reported. “We’ve adjudicated more than 60 of those. We will continue to do that,” he said.  Republican lawmakers in Washington had distanced themselves from Moore and called for him to drop out of the race after several women accused him of sexual assault or misconduct dating back to when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s.  Moore has denied wrongdoing and Reuters has not been able to independently verify the allegations.'''\n",

            "The review 'In this #METOO moment, many powerful men are being toppled. It spans many industries, from entertainment, to journalism, to politics and beyond. Any man that ever dared to abuse his power to sexually harass, molest, or assault women better brace himself for being rooted out, publicly shamed, and forced into early retirement.Well, unfortunately, the latest bombshell story has actually resulted in the suicide of a lawmaker. Kentucky State Representative Dan Johnson left a suicide note on Facebook and then shot himself on a bridge, according to reports from local authorities. Bullitt County Sheriff Donnie Tinnell reported to local station WDRB that Johnson s body was found after his suicide note from Facebook was reported to the local police. Here is that note:Now, nobody wants to celebrate a suicide. This man should have resigned gracefully and faced his accuser, who was a friend of his daughter s, who says that Johnson molested her while she was passed out drunk in his home. Apparently, Johnson, who referred to himself as some kind of  pope,  routinely engaged in parties with plenty of alcohol with minors. Johnson s home was called the  Pope s House,  and he was the preacher at the Heart of Fire City Church, where the alleged molestation took place.Now, innocent until proven guilty and all of that, but if someone commits suicide, it s likely there could be some merit there. That s a rather extreme measure to take. Further, by all accounts, this guy was no saint. He was heavily pro-gun, opposed any and all abortion rights, and has referred to President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as monkeys on his Facebook page, among other racist messages and images.Again, we re not glad the man is dead. But, it is important for people to remember him for exactly who he was. We grieve for the loss his children, wife, and grandchildren suffered, for nobody deserves such a loss. However, methinks the people of Kentucky are much better off. Sad to say, but true.Featured image via screen capture' is predicted as:\n",
